# Artificial Intelligence Course Summary

## Course Title: Artificial Intelligence (AI)
## Duration: 6 Months
## Instructor: Razorshi Talukder (Lecturer, NEUB)

# Purpose of the Course
The purpose of this course was to introduce the fundamental principles, techniques, and applications of Artificial Intelligence. It aimed to build a solid understanding of how intelligent agents operate, how problems are solved using search and logic, and how knowledge is represented, reasoned, and learned. The course also emphasized real-world AI applications like game playing, robotics, natural language processing, and constraint satisfaction.
